#title:Which classes are declared in the dataset?
#comment:There are 2 common ways of defining classes (using rdfs or owl).
#comment:You could say a ?class is connected by rdf:type = a to rdfs:Class or or you could say a ?class is a owl:Class. 
    
SELECT distinct ?class
WHERE {
    ?class a rdfs:Class
    #you may want to replace rdfs:Class with owl:Class
}
ORDER BY ?class
